Some additional information on the home:       Franks De Groot was a very well-known and popular architect in Austin in the 1950’s through the 1970’s.  He designed a number of homes in Austin during this period, and his focus was mainly on the mid-century modern themes of Frank Lloyd Wright with the goal of having the structure organically integrated with the space and topography of the site. He designed this house in 1964 for Rowland and Flora Petit, two UT PhD professors – Rowland, Chemistry and Flora, a biological researcher. After the home was finished, they added the pool and Koi Pond in the front yard along with the courtyard wall.  He was from Australia and added the lava rock touches in the courtyard as part of the pool project. Like any good artist, De Groot signed his work, but on a rafter in the attic not seen for many years. It was not found until a skylight was added in the mid 2000’s.

Located on a 0.24 acre lot, this home has traditional curb appeal and stylish landscaping. The age and classic exterior of the home does not reflect what you find inside: an exquisite contemporary jewel box with a serene color palette, an open floor plan, and a modern kitchen that feels luxuriously minimalist in style. The primary suite is located on the main level and instantly relaxes with soft, diffused natural light and an elegant ensuite bath and walk-in closet. The steel windows and doors paired with the warm, white oak hardwood floors provide a luxe backdrop for those with a transitional style. Downstairs includes another room that can serve as study, play room, gym or guest quarters and leads out to the brick-paved side terrace with outdoor fireplace and wonderful privacy. Upstairs are three additional bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a charming attic space (not included in the SF calculation) that offers many possibilities for use. This home features two sets of Washer/Dryers - one upstairs and one down. The fenced-in backyard and playscape lead out to the detached casita, a 1 bed, 1 bath studio with kitchenette and vaulted ceilings. Detached 2-car Carport is behind the gated drive and offers additional storage space.

Walking distance from West Enfield Park and the Lions Municipal Golf Course, it is snuggled in an enclave filled with beautiful homes, large lots and verdant trees shading walkable streets. Tucked in this quiet neighborhood you would never guess that the excitement of downtown Austin and the beauty of Lady Bird Lake are just two miles away; both are close enough to be accessible by bike as well. The exceptional update to this house has created a residence that honors the elegance of the original architecture and expands on it to create an exciting, livable home for a modern lifestyle. Four living areas—a formal parlor, cozy library, sunny family room and treetop playroom. The light-flooded kitchen is outfitted with gourmet appliances including a Le Cornue range, wine fridge, natural stone and shimmering tile. The sunny, main-floor primary suite enjoys a luxurious bath featuring a freestanding soaking tub accented with artisan tilework. The second floor is a kid’s dream, with two bedrooms flanking a cozy playroom. A fourth en-suite bedroom opens up to a turfed rooftop patio with a pergola-shaded seating area. Throughout you will find a blend of rich tradition and contemporary style; burnished original hardwood floors and detailed mantels are juxtaposed with colorful tile, gleaming stone and whimsical wallpaper. Outdoor living is equally inspired, with a sparkling pool anchoring plenty of grassy space and a summer kitchen off the family room.
